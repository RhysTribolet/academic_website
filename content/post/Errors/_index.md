Why errors are the most important thing for practice

“Learning cannot occur in the absence of information.” (Guadagnoli & Lee, 2004)

I participated in many teams across many sports when I grew up. A majority of the coaches I had all had common sayings, with one of these being “no drop balls”. Whether it was basketball, rugby or touch football. But why do coaches generally encourage practice without errors, and what affect does this have on match-day performance? 


Across all domains, errors and mistakes are important. The importance of errors originates from the idea that a mistake presents an opportunity to learn from the mistake. But before I go into why errors are important for performance in team sport, we must differentiate two important concepts: performance and learning. 

Performance is a temporary and acute change in behaviour. 

Learning is a long-term adaptation that results in a more permanent and sustainable behaviour change. 

The paradox here is that errors enhance learning outcomes whilst concurrently hindering the acute performance of the skill. 
For example, a performer may be practicing handballing during training. They may be passing to a stationary target, consistently making successful passes that the recipient player catches. Here, the acute performance is very good. There are no mistakes as the conditions are repetitive and predictable. However, if we introduced a defender and a moving target, acute performance becomes poorer due to the increased uncertainty of where to pass to, which hand to pass with and what impact the defender will have. The second condition is more challenging, more engaging and demands increased attention from the player that is handballing because of the unpredictability. As a result, there are more errors in this context, compared to the first. BUT, there is greater learning as the performer adapts how they plan, respond and execute the handball. Moreover, because the performer is continually adapting, they will likely make more errors.


Hence, errors can provide an indication or proxy of the potential for learning.


Errors are important for learning, but the issue concerning coaches is how do we implement an appropriate amount of challenge (that results in errors) that is specific for the task and the skill level of the performer? We definitely do not want to design practice that doesn’t correspond to the level of the performer(s). Here, making practice too easy can be demotivating as it doesn’t challenge, and making practice too hard can lead to frustration. In both scenarios, there may not be adequate benefits.  
 



In 2004, Guadagnoli and Lee proposed the Challenge Point framework. Here, the authors detail the effects of practice conditions relative to skill level of the performer and task difficulty. Figure 1 below demonstrates the function between task performance and task difficulty. The section in yellow encompasses an area of skill performance where the task or exercise is very simple and therefore easy to perform, which leads to increased performance. The section in red encompasses increased task or exercise difficulty where performance of the skill is decreased. The white zone in the middle presents a zone where there is desirable difficulty (Yan, Guadagnoli & Haycocks, 2019). This zone in the middle and where the large dot is, presents the optimal challenge point, where the performer makes a moderate amount of errors, but is still able to successfully perform the skill quite well. Immediate performance in this zone is not optimal, but it presents an appropriate amount of failure.

Figure 1. A graphical depiction of the optimal challenge point (OCP). The solid line is performance on the immediate task, the dotted line represents learning. The peak of the dotted curve represents the difficulty level at which learning is optimised.

In the middle section in Figure 1, there is failure occurring, but at an appropriate and motivating level. As a result, there is decreased and poorer short-term performance, but increased and superior long-term learning. Long-term learning results in enhanced skill retention and transfer to other similar contexts, like competitive games. 

Because unpredictable training activities leads to increased uncertainty of outcomes like who to pass to and where/when to make the pass, the performer must solve numerous problems instantaneously. This makes learning a continuous problem-solving process. Performers or players must continually adapt to each changing scenario. 
Within each scenario, the information the performers utilise to make decisions may change. Here, information represents the key points of the environment that the players use to make decisions, such as where the defenders are, how fast they are moving, the position of the boundary lines, the position of the closest teammate etc. As a rule of thumb, the more information in an activity, the more challenging it will be for the performers. 
However, there is a critical assumption here: as suggested by Martiniuk (1976), practice leads to redundancy and lower uncertainty (i.e. improved anticipation, decision-making and skill; Farrow et al., 2013), and as a result, reduced information. It is like driving a car. When you were learning, you were highly engaged, attentive, likely did not play music loudly and did not chat with some concurrently. As you get better, you don’t need to pay as much attention to the performance of the skill. This showcases how humans seek efficiency and demonstrates that the economy of attention improves with increased practice. 

The reduced information that Martiniuk referred to suggests that the challenge point for the performer will change with increased amounts of practice. That is, as the performer gets better, the coaches must design practice that is scaled to appropriately continue to challenge the performer. This way, information presented to the performer(s) is still relevant and maintains engagement and attention. 

Additional to these points concerns how we scale practice appropriately for performers of different skill levels. 


How can the challenge point framework help us cater for different skill levels? 

As coaches or practitioners helping coaches design practice, we cannot implement the same activity for experts or professionals and then for novices and expect the same response or benefits.  

On this concern, Guadagnoli and Lee (2004) depict an appropriate figure that helps visualise the varying challenge point for the level of performer a coach is working with. 

 

Figure 2. Optimal challenge points for learning (retention and transfer) related to different skill levels, functional task difficulty, and potential available information arising from action, with optimal challenge points resulting earlier (lower functional difficulty) for less experienced performers. 


In Figure 2, increases in task difficulty are accompanied by increases in the amount of potential available information. Relatedly, an increase in task difficulty has a subsequent increase in the uncertainty of the outcome(s). For example, performing a handballing game with 10 players (5v5) in a space that is 20m wide by 40m long is much more complex and has much more information accompanying it compared to a stationary handballing activity that involves passing back and forth to other stationary targets. 

The different lines and their shapes in Figure 2 portray scaled challenge points for each level of performers: beginners, intermediates, skilled and experts. 
The challenge point for beginners showcases low task difficulty relative to the performers experience and practice history, which provides considerably more information to guide decision-making in the activity. In comparison, the skilled performer can perform a skill which has increased difficulty, but the amount of specifying information in the activity that the skilled performer uses is not as large compared to the beginner (likely due to experiencing it and adapting to it in previous experience or practice). As such, the challenge point for beginners would be lower than what it would be for skilled or expert performers as they can likely be very general in what information they use (e.g. where the ball is, where the goals are, the rules of the game etc). 

This also relates to previous reports by Farrow and colleagues (2013), which details that as expertise increases, the information players utilise to make decisions and regulate behaviour must be very specific and very similar to competitive environments (e.g. the velocity of passing, the aggressiveness of defensive pressure, the cues they interpret from a one-on-one contest when there is a long kick etc). 

To conclude, I will discuss how coaches and practitioners can help integrate the challenge point framework to optimise desirable difficulty in practice.  


There are a few concerns and subsequent methods to do help optimise its implementation. 

1.	Time

The time on task is one of the most important aspects of skill acquisition (REF). The time you have with the player(s) will likely be a large determining factor as to what practice you implement and how long you perform it for. 

Principally, 










Low interference (blocked)	      Moderate interference	      High interference (random) 



On time and errors:
•	If you have a short amount of time in the session, it is more beneficial to performed consistent, blocked style practice
•	If you have more time in the session, it is more beneficial to perform random style practice
•	The best approach is the integration of both blocked and random practice schedules, as they both help facilitate confidence, acute performance, information detection, appropriate challenge, retention and transfer. 


2.	Feedback


Makes the task more difficult when no augmented feedback is provided.

Also in the figure, the points represent the optimal amount of potential interpretable information. 


If information is to serve a role, it must be interpretable (Guadagnoli and Lee, 2004). 



So how do we incorporate desirable difficulty and challenge into practice? There are a few strategies:

1.	Randomise the skill being performed
For example, you could implement a circuit type activity where the players/ performers execute a handball under pressure, then have to mark the ball overhead and then perform a short kick to a player running towards them

2.	Randomise the context the skill is performed under
For example, perform a pass under frontal pressure from a defender, then from lateral pressure, then from two defenders etc. 

Now, how can we assess whether the challenge is optimal? If resources permit, a skill acquisition practitioner can codify and quantify the amount of errors and the type of each errors occurring. For example, simply quantifying the number of turnovers and the passing efficiency provides an indication of the amount of challenge in the activity. 

In amateur sport, a coach can observe the activity and implement a general 30-40% rate of failure as optimal challenge. That is, 3-4/10 executions of a specific aspect of play sees the team or player make an error.
